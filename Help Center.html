                <h3>What is the return policy?</h3>
                    <p>We want ME-Kaya customers to be completely satisfied with their
                        purchases! You have 14 days from the delivery date to return unopened
                        and unused items in original packaging for a full refund. Opened items
                        can also be returned for a full refund if they are defective or significantly
                        different from the description we provided. Digital downloads and
                        custom-made items are not eligible or qualified for return. To return an
                        item, contact us for a return authorization number and follow the easy
                        return instructions we will provide. We will process your return and issue a
                        full refund within five business days of receiving it back. For more details,
                        please contact our team through the mobile number or email provided on
                        our page

                <h3>What are the shipping options available?</h3>
                    <p>We offer a variety of shipping options to fit your needs and budget!
                        Choose standard shipping for cost-effective delivery in 3-7 business days,
                        or upgrade to fast shipping for speedier arrival within 1-3 business days.
                        For the most urgent needs, we offer next-day delivery in select areas.
                        Free shipping is available for orders above a certain amount, or you can
                        choose our flat-rate shipping option for simpler pricing. We also provide
                        additional services like signature confirmation, where the carrier requires
                        someone to sign for it upon delivery for added security, international
                        shipping for global customers, and local pickup for those in our area to
                        save on costs.

                <h3>When will I receive my order?</h3>

                        displayed on your product pages and during checkout. However,
                        order processing, carrier delays, and holidays could affect delivery
                        times. We will also provide a user-friendly order tracking system
                        where customers can easily monitor the status of their shipment.</p>
